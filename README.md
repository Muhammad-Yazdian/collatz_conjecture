# Collatz Conjecture
Collatz conjecture (a.k.a. 3n+1 conjecture) is a sequence of numbers that regardless of an initial value it always falls in a 4-2-1 loop. The conjecture rules are:

1. Pick any positive integer number n
2. If n is  
   even, then **n = n / 2**  
   odd, then **n = 3 * n + 1**

Despite its simple rules, the Collatz conjecture is still **an unsolved mathematic problem**!

**Paul ErdÅ‘s** said:
> Mathematics may not be ready for such problems.
